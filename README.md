# String-Searching-Algorithms-Comparison
A Python-based project that implements and compares four classic string-searching algorithms — Naive, KMP, Boyer-Moore, and Aho-Corasick — from scratch. The program evaluates their performance on texts of varying lengths and pattern counts, measuring metrics like execution time and match frequency.
