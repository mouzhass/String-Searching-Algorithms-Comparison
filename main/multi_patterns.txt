This document contains several fruits and objects used for testing.
We want to search for words such as apple, banana, orange, and melon.
The Aho-Corasick algorithm should handle all patterns together.
Meanwhile, KMP and Boyer-Moore must search for each word separately.
This helps us compare multi-pattern performance.
