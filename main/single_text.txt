The old library in town has a hidden room behind the history section.
Only a few people know about the secret, and even fewer have seen the room.
Inside the room, there is a dusty desk with a single notebook on top.
The notebook contains a mysterious word written many times: starlight.
People say whoever discovers the meaning of starlight will unlock a great secret.
Lira visited the library to look for clues about starlight and understand its power.
Rumors say starlight connects different stories and forgotten memories.
The goal of this test is to find every time the word starlight appears in this text.
